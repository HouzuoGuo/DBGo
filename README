"DBGo" is a light-weight relational database engine implemented in Go programming language.
It is a programming exercise I gave to myself when I began to learn Go.

Primary features:
1. Create/rename/delete tables.
2. Add/delete table columns.
3. Insert/update/delete table rows.
4. Primary key, foreign key constraints.
5. Update restricted & delete restricted triggers.
6. Table locks: exclusive and shared locks.
7. Basic transaction management: roll-back support.
8. Relational algebras: select, project, join, redefine.
9. Only one data type: string.
10. Nicely formatted table data file (Like a spreadsheet).
11. Easy to extend and customize to suit your needs.
